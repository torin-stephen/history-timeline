### Files
- [index.html](#index)
- [output.html](#output)
- [gen.py](#gen)
- [data.txt](#data)

### <a name="index">index.html</a>
This is the main page of the website. CSS and main code from W3.

### <a name="output">output.html</a>
This is the page generated by the [gen.py](#gen) script. I then copy it into the main [index.html](#index) and edit if needed.

### <a name="gen">gen.py</a>
This is the python script which uses a template I made to go through the [data.txt](#data) file and loop through until all the data is added to the timeline.

### <a name="data">data.txt</a>
This is the data that is the input to the python script. It comes from a quizlet for the GCSE Cold War dates.
